# n8n Audio Hosting Repository

This repository is used to **store `.mp3` audio files** generated dynamically by an [n8n](https://n8n.io/) workflow.  
The audio files are uploaded to this repo via GitHub API and then served publicly using the [jsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).

---

## Purpose

- Automate audio file generation (e.g., TTS or AI-generated voice messages) in n8n.
- Upload audio files to this repo automatically.
- Use the public jsDelivr URLs to play audio in phone calls or other applications.

## How it works
1. Node gets data from **googlesheets** and returns client data 
2. Using that client data **Agent** generates costum text messages 
3.  Generated **text messages** are sent to clinets number
4. An `.mp3` file is generated by an n8n node using **TTS models **  and sent as binary data.
6. n8n converts the binary data to base64 and uploads it to this GitHub repo using the GitHub API.
7. The file is accessible publicly through jsDelivr CDN at the URL:
